we will call the step size as h

all we care about is the error is small enough and we can evaluate it
if we "looking at a, then the y axis will be f(a)"

How to expand it to 3 terms
By taylor expansion, we can find value at a random points, by using the value on the nearby points
small number, will decrease very fast

when we talk about solution or roots of the function, we will find with the x = 0


# Bisectional Method to find the root
don't forget to send the error to make sure you know if you have the problem



for a fixed point, what you hope for, by just finding the function value in that point, you're getting closer and closer to that solution

we kinda know that the fix point will be at the "intersection"

"under the slope" -> then its smaller than x
the problem with not converging, is you don't know where you're jumping to
bisection method will guarantee that you will find the solution by using bisection

make sure you know the function value at some points
let assume you also know the derivative


f(x) = a(x-b)(x-c)(x-d)
ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d
