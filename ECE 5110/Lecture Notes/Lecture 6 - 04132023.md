Newton method

Taylor Theorem
everything is based on the taylor theorem
bunch of unknows
N functions, N values, N unknows
you should expect an N by N matrix (N^2) Computation

Jacobian Matrix
This type of derivative, when you have a bunch of unknown, you will call it a partial derivative

go back one step for that specific variable, and use the regular function (way to find the derivative)

try to find a partial derivative
you have a function in N unknown (N variables)
find derivative in the specific ones
partial derivative against the third unknown
by definition of partial derivative, you can find that partial derivative by moving in this direction (>)
calculate function value in that point

Still polynomial (sine and cosine), derivative against x2 in the point 1,2,3
x1-xn is known 


CALCULATE IT N TIMES

Xk + 1 will be your new guess (current estimate)
f(Xk) -> is the value of each function at that point

Numerical Method, you don't calculate it analytically

N by N matrix that we know how to calculate
the vector unknown (a*x = )

Sum of the function value

the way you evaluate the error

colum vector with value of the estimate
way you calculate the errror is evaluate the current estimate (adding the square)

what other matrix we can use the evaluate the error besides of adding the square of the function value

zero, 90, and the equator

you cannot use derivatives
you should know how to calculate the function value

you can use previous functions for the

Solve non - linear will use jacobian
and solve linear
implementing solve non-linear system
