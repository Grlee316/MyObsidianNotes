function create jacobian
function create b

for the seminar, you need to have a solve non linear system, a complete one
seminar is next tuesday if you're ready

what we have ready for the seminar:
-> function_solve_nonlinearsystem
--> loop (create A)
![[Pasted image 20230418195156.png]]

-> expect to see plots

non linear system
focus on these three lines
![[Pasted image 20230418195344.png]]
first we need to do *jacobian
solve this sytem, to find a linear to find the Y
check for errors*
x(k) is known
to update x, you add this result with current (your new guess)

Y + your new guess

```latex
$$
\sum_{k=3}^5 k^2=3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 50
$$

# Chance to redeem
"create to articles"

2 pages or something
make it so represent you
something from ODE, or PDE (numerical solutions) -> Partial Differential Equation, 
can pick a very specific calculation
look over one part of the chapter that you want to learn about
make a "cheat sheet of that small part of the TEXTBOOK"
you only care about the specific one?

Numerical Solutions for Ordinary Differential Equation or Partial Differential Equation
(first derivative, second derivative)

# ODE

Central Difference method:

plot and estimate how much it deviates

boudary value problem (initial value problem)
pick up your own equaltin etc

it has to be differential equation
