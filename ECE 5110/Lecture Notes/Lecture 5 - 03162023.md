Liniear system of equation vs non linear system of equation
x squared, xy, is a non linear system of equation
using jacobian matrix


normalizing system of equation, you need to make the maximum coefficient

```matlab
A = [[2 -4 1];[-3 1 100];[5 5 1]];
B = [16 184 22];

X = A / B
```

gaussian elimination
![[Pasted image 20230316193354.png]]

back subtitution

why do you normalized it? because of the error in numerical computation
divide by the maximum coeficient (within the same scale) 

how to do gaussian elimination

identity matrix

switching the first two row is the same as switching the two collumn

eye(3) -> will give you identity matrix

how we can swap rows on the matrix
identity matrix with the rows that we want to change
you're looking for the rows, not the column


# Lecture 6 - 03212023
m matrix
the goal now is to build these relationship
L1, need to stay the same, L2 need to do the substraction


![[Pasted image 20230321191022.png]]
the end goal are for those to be 0

![[Pasted image 20230321192113.png]]

do line switching

![[Pasted image 20230321192356.png]]
whatever you multiply that with, you cannot make it zero
absolute value, 0 is the smallest number

cannot divide by 0
-6 in abs is bigger than 4

![[Pasted image 20230321192632.png]]
Line 1 will stay the same
Line 2 and 3 will switch

^ to switch or swap the lines

![[Pasted image 20230321193314.png]]
looks like upper diagonal matrix
![[Pasted image 20230321193225.png]]
the 4th column is the free terms

this need to go with some kind of loop
![[Pasted image 20230321193417.png]]
101 * x3  = 202
202-> b3

in order for us to do the gaussian elimination, we need to normalize the matrix


![[Pasted image 20230321194504.png]]![[Pasted image 20230321194601.png]]
max per column by using the max

![[Pasted image 20230321195206.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230321200419.png]]
need to know index 2, need to know where we're at
![[Pasted image 20230321201509.png]]


implement the same code on the white board
write code that do this or do that, because you might be next

index and some matrix
![[Pasted image 20230323191619.png]]
identity matrix where first and last line will be switched

![[Pasted image 20230323192437.png]]
wherever you see one here, you need to write steps

need to stop one step earlier
