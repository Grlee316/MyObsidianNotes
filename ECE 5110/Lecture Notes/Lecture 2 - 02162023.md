for two points, we can use first degree polynomial
for three points, we can use quadratic equation

linear independent of each other (you cannot combine the three points to make the fourth one)

in order to make the splines more smooth, then you add more degree and constraint (the cubit)

1. define your own metric that gives you how good is your approximation (for the least square)

err = y0-f(x)
	1. metric (smething to measure), how good this line is
	2. we can call this an error
	3. known: the points
	4. not known: the a and b
	5. error from the metric above, because there's two on the left, and there's two on the right, so you need to make it absolute. 
	6. you need to find the minimum or a maximum
	7. derivative = 0 , so it will be either minimum and maximum
	8. you can also make it a power of 2 -> that makes it RMS
	9. partial dev against each one of the unknown
	10.

Everything that's from derivative comes from newton

Replace a1 to what we just found
![[Pasted image 20230221194003.png]]
the denominator always the difference between the highest and lowest exes involved

# Lagrange Interpolation
in the code, you want it to be one when you build the polynomial

first lagrange polynomial will force us to 
validate for the first point, zero for everything else
lagrange coefficient being zeroes and 1



# Spline interpolation
third degree polynomial to make the curve "more smooth"
in between every three points, you will have a different third degree function

two adjecent polynomial need to be close to each other

ot will give you the "smooth feeling"
the second derivative give you convex or concave on the extremes
"the same convexity", more smooth even in the region / the area
you can then add more constraint

**just trend and newton**

the spline will be used for an n known and n unknown equation



# TREND:
- Least Squares ( Trend/Linear Approximation)
- (using the RMS), so the least squares in order to have a better equation
- "Linear Trend Approximation"



# Interpolation with One Polynomial
- Lagrange
- Newton
