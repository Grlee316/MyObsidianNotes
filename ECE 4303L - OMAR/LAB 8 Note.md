The intermittent connectivity issue is due to misconfigured channel settings. Since the wireless mode is set to g, there are three non-overlapping channels associated with it, which are 1, 6, and 11. The channels for AP2 and AP3 are set to 2 and 3, respectively, which is the cause of interference and frequent connectivity issues. Here's how to configure the channel settings:

2. Click on AP2 and change the channel to 6. Save the configuration.

4. Click on AP3 and change the channel to 11. Save the configuration.
