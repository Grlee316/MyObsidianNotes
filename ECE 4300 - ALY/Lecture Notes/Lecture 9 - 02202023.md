there's no fractional instruction, since instruction is an integer, there's no fractional instruction
best CPI if its close to 1

one and zero, if you put it in different context will have different meaning
if you want to talk to the alu, then you put the opcode 000000

rotate right
rotate left
shift left
shift right
shift logical left -> pushing from the right, with zero, so you push the bits to the right with zeros
shift logical right -> pushing from the left

shift with the value with the MSB

subtitute box
changing linearity 

memory is a buch of transistor

you cannot thave a number of GPR that's not integer, like 300.80. 

shift right, will divide by 2, then the result is lost (because its integer)

sbox-> linear to a non linear

SLT -> signed
SLTU -> Unsigned
SLTI
SLTUI

indirection


global pointer can move anywhere between the memory
stack pointer, can only move inside the stack
frame is bigger than stack, but not bigger than the global pointer
