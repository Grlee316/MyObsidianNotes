- Study performance metrics
	- Determine the benefit/lack of benefir of design
	- performance bottlenectks
	- mean to measure and how you measure it

Understanding performance
- Algorithm
- Programming language, comp arch
- Processor and memory system
- I/O system

factors to determine performance:
- TechnologyTech
- Organization
- Software

Metrics that measure performance:
- Execution time : time to execute one program from beginning to end
	-> **Performance = 1/Execution time**
	Comparing between two processors, A, B -> 25/20 = 1.25 -> A is 1.25 times faster than B

	Measuring Execution Time:
	- Elapsed time: Total response time including all aspect
	- CPU execution time: the time CPU sends executing an application
	-> **CPU Execution Time = CPU CLOCK CYCLES x Clock Cycle Time**

		- Clock cycle time = 1 / clock cycle rate
		- CPU Execution time  = CPU Clock Cycles / Clock Cycle Rate

- Response time : how long it takes to do a task

- Throughput : Total amount of work completed in given time

- Component metrics : subsystem performance
