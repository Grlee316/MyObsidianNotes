HLS -> high level language
(High Level synthesis)
system verilog, HDL, VHDL, Verilog
Think at the higher abstraction, and how you can go down layer by layer


myHDL, SCALA, CHISEL
community pushing for risc5 so arm weak

The output will come out after 5 second, this is a simulation code, not a testing code
since assign #5 setting the timing (delay for 5 second and more)

Bit level vs Bus LEVEL

Blocking -> Have to be sequential (waiting for other process to finish first)
Non-Blocking -> not sequential (can jump between several different processes)

sometimes active low is great
sometimes active high is great

1 Bit Full Adder
default means for military application, so it will go to a default case (shut down) just in case they do EMT

Data Flow Representation
multiplexer in somewhat works like a bus
the circuit will not work, if something will change into a latch

something about <=

if we need to do something else




# BENCHMARK

number of cycles per instruction
it should be 4.0 cycles / instruction (because of floating points instructions)


![[Pasted image 20230227123640.png]]
CPU time will be number of instruction x CPI / Clock rate

multiply and add, and divide by the total number of instruction

Calculate MIPS -> will be zero (since its in flops)

# pay attention to the method below

4.12 CPI is better because its closer to 1.0 CPI, so it is faster or better (the increase of the transistors) improves the processor

improvement by 0.5 second

FOR INTEGER ONLY
if you increase the GPR, you need more MUX, so you can choose the "GPR"
