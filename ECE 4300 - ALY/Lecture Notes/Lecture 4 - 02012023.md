The end of the Moores law era

Single electron transistors
Physical meaning and mathematical meaning 

==============================================
Multiprocessors:

Literally every single core is the processor itself
Microcontroller is to control a single task, and it does not have OS

Raspberry PICO


What kind of program that will seperate the task to different core of the multiprocessor

EDGE Computing->
EDGE PC -> High performance computing
they run a scheduler on them
you will asign a job, and the scheduler will assign and routing it to different nodes



Kubernetes -> Scheduler
- K3S (lower version)
- K8S can run with GPU
Kafka Kubernetes -> Floating software
- stream
Aphace Flink -> using it for drone



Docker:
- dependecies of the environment of the thing is not there
- docker is packing everthing and close it as a box
- when you run it on your machine, it will be like the "virtual machine on your computer"
- Open LN and kubernetes run on the top of docker


MPI and open MPI
Core have a bunch of threads
yolo algorithm -> pretrained model 
yolo 1 - 7

benchmark started with CPU, then they create GPU
Hetergeneous system
Rhodenia


cluster of FPGA with HBM (High Bandwidth Memory)

SPEC CPU Benchmark
- Standard Performance Evaluation Corp

You cannot improve to infinity
80/infinity = 0, so in theory it could not happen, in quantum its possible

Remember THE FORMULA:
about the overall SPEEDUP!!!
Remember there are no units

==============================
Approximate Computing (per person)
-> Write the IEEE format about it
-> abstract (250 words)
-> small introductions (blah blaj)
-> conclusion
-> reference
dont use I, we etc, just simple tense, present tense

=====================================
PERF, ETC ETC

Typically its 1.0 

PICO is 2 core
-> TinyOS
-> Fizix

bitscope
Open MP -> MP5
Chip aging (if we're using a section of a chip too much while not using the other ones)

Inference systems

What are the difference between elapsed time and CPU time?

ISA -> Instruction Sets Architecture

Amdal's Law is the expert to figure out where is the problem
**NO UNITS NO UNITS NO UNITS**

Don't ask something that will never happens

MIPS -> Million of Instructions Per Seconds
(dedicated for integer processes)

FLOPS is the floating points processes
if floating points, and and we use mips, it should be zero, since its not a integer


Fine Grained Architecture
	-FPGA

CGRA -> Coarse Grain
	have a big pipeline
	HBM -> High Bandwidth Memory


ISA
	- CISC
	- VLSW
	- RISC
		- ARM
		- MIPS

compiler what constraint you sometimes
every single problem have infinite solution

HLS, OpenCL, Chisel, MyHDL, Scala, Pylog

Does the performance really improving with the amount of technology being offered


Execution time is usually the best performance measure

Critical Path -> Slowest is the best
not every time the fastest is the winner
what's the limitation in our technology
