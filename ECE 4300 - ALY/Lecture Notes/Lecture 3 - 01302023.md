Power calculation = P = 0.5 cvf^2
VLIW -> Very Large Instruction Word

Each Neutron have 3 quark

How Performance Evaluation Works?
-  Performance Matrix we're evaluating:
	- Execution Time
	- CPI
	- Throughput
	- Response Time
	- Elapsed Time

====================================================
Look into the algorithm
Learning Computer Architecture, you can bring the algorithm into a operation
under operation, you will be able to get the instructions
after that you can see how many cycles
after that you can see hjow many transistor needed

after all of that, you can see the power needed, and energy used

====================================================

Operating Systems affecting the performance, and it also have layers
and you will need layers, that's why people uses c
API

====================================================

Technology:
CMOS -> 180 nm, 90 nm, 45 nm, etc etc
why is it important? NAND and NOR Gate will be different, combinational circuit will be different

Crystal generating train of pulses, direction is the same and keep repeating

f = 1/T
"on equals off", and ON is what we call duty cycle
and if on is different, we got PWM

Processor is 2 pieces, sequential and combinational circuit
- SR Latch
	- SR Flip Flop
		- Modified, and creating JK FF
			- Start making "jumpers or trimming those wires"
				- D FF -> can be used to store data, or SRAM
				- T FF -> 

STA -> Static Timing Analysis
Defining the longest time will define the frequency of the system
There can be a timing violation, thus the circuit "will not work"

EDA tools: 
- Vivado
- Cadance
- Synopsis
- Quantics
- Openlane
- 

Chisel, Verilog, System Verilo, myHDL, 
Chisel: you write something using SDP (like java), almost like verilog
HLS -> High Level Synthesis 
"High Level of Abstractions"
Scala

====================================================

# Execution Time
	- Time from beggining to the end of the program
	- ISA -> Instruction sets Architechture
	- Program will be translated to Instructions
	- will be equal to the number of instructions 
	- ISA = (no. of Instruction ***x*** no. of cycle per instructions (CPI) ) / frequency rate
	- f  = 1/T
	- T = 1/f
	- Execution time of what???? (can be called Elapsed Time if includes everything in the systems)
		systems -> memory, epn 
				  -> IO -> mouse, key, etc
		Can also be CPU TIME		
# CPI
	- CYCLE PER INSTRUCTIONS
	- CISC -> every single instruction have number of different execution time
	- THERE IS A PRECISION OF THE CPI (1.0)
	- should be 1.0
	- profiling tools:
		- PERF, SPERF, OPERF
		- sometimes CPI lowers than 1.0, that's because it looks through multiple domains
		- 
# Throughput
	- How much work per second over time unit we can deliver to you
	- so bigger much better
	- smaller much worse
	- one of the key matrics people use to compare between computing platforms
# Response Time
	- subroutines (those take times)
	- 
# Elapsed Time


====================================================
Memory consumes the most energy
(buffer through FIFO (speed of the memory and speed of the processor))

SIMD
MIMD

OPENCL, CUDA
C is good, every single processor have their own assembler

Quality of compilers is important


Einstain -> system inside a system
System evaluation for the "subsystem inside of the system itself"


====================================================

# Isolating the CPU as a "subsystem"

====================================================

RISING EDGE, FALLING EDGE
Building memory that execute in both rising edge and falling edge

1 MHz = 1uS
1 GHz = 1nS

RISC VS CISC
RISC have single time for single instruction
CISC multiple timing/cycles different by instructions

![[Pasted image 20230130141254.png]]

Same instruction, same architecture


At the end of the day, CPI will increase
