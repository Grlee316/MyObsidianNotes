Immediate 

all you need to do is to pick up and to store
signed and unsigned
loadword means you are taking the word from memory
storeword means you're storing to that location in the memory

pages making an ant looks like an elephant
the processor does not know a "shit" about the cache (or the memory exist)

there is another jump involving I, R, J together
(Branch Equal Branch Not Equal)

island in matlab for fortran
or c in assembly

floating point process
Little Endian vs Big Endian

RIJ

R -> Data Processing through the GPR (subtract, multiply, devide)
I -> partially for data processing (subtract, multiply, devide with constant)
and memory accessibility
J -> is for control

Arithmetic shifting
rotate left
rotate right

rotate left 2 and rotate right 2 is the same if 

I type->
add immediate (addi)
snbi

READ the question carefully

before you debug, flip the data, and see if its works
everyone have their own stuffs to see their power constraint
intel -> more to personal computers
IBM -> focus more on the server and business
power 7 already top of the rover at mars
