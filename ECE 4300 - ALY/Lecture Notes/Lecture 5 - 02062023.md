Every processor have their own assembler
Interlocked - Flagged with protocol, so you can "negotiate"

RISC 
	- Data cannot be processed directly, it has to go to GPR first


Study how often an instruction will be used so you will create that instruction

Main focus of chapter 2:
LANGUAGE

MIPS -> Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelines Stages
	- Is RISC architecture
	- was developed as part of VLSI research program
	- its actually microprocessor, so higher than microcontroller, but lower than processor

- if interlock:
	- single cycle implementation
	- need to finish the cycle first before the next instruction
	- pipelining is streaming "without interlock"
	- we're "dumping data" if something happens in between
	- if with interlock, they need the "handshake"
	- Now there's queue, and "buffering"
	- 10^14 neurons -> human have this

later versions of the MIPS ISA did not have interlocking

i.e. 0000 in opcode is talking to ALU
Everything is "addition"

Should include the following five types:
	- Arithmetic Instructions
	- Data transfer
	- Logic Instructions
	- Program-control instructions
	- Input-output


64 bit architechture, what's the size of the memory? 64

best architecture for mips is pipelining, multicycle approach

pc = pc + 4

align memory
