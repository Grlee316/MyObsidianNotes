After learning about  egoism- you could talk about how the Argument for desiring more  profit increases the amount of Nitrates-Looking out for ourselves- Ethical egoism says that there is one ultimate moral duty- to improve your own well-being as best you can. You could relate this to making money with a larger herd or with more cropland that needs fertilizer and then discuss the Nitrates.

Some ideas include-

Nitrates-what does to much do to humans?

Should Nitrates be regulated?

What options do ranchers have for dealing with waste?

Discuss sources of Nitrate Pollution

Nitrate Affecting Groundwater- Is it widespread?
