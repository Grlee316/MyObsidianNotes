What is Egoism? [https://youtu.be/jpHggd-3_rMLinks to an external site.](https://youtu.be/jpHggd-3_rM) Extra information do not reference please  

After learning about  egoism- you could talk about how the Argument for desiring more  profit increases the amount of Nitrates-Looking out for ourselves- Ethical egoism says that there is one ultimate moral duty- to improve your own well-being as best you can. You could relate this to making money with a larger herd or with more cropland that needs fertilizer and then discuss the Nitrates.

Some ideas include-

Nitrates-what does to much do to humans?

Should Nitrates be regulated?

What options do ranchers have for dealing with waste?

Discuss sources of Nitrate Pollution

Nitrate Affecting Groundwater- Is it widespread?

Each paragraph has a quote from the book and at least one cited paraphrase or quote from another source that relates to the agriculture issue brought up in the yellow highlighted video. Four total sources for the assignment!

**CH 8**

**Ethical egoism tells us that even when the stakes are very high for others, and very small for ourselves, we are entitled to ignore the needs,  wants, and interests of those who are our equals in all relevant ways. Egoism completely denies the moral importance of other people or other things (such as the environment), except insofar as they can help us to benefit ourselves.** That is a kind of deep bias that requires substantial defense. It isn't clear what that defense would be.  Page (118)

**CH 9**

The standard view is the first one. Right actions are those that actually bring about the best possible results. But since these are still in the future when the action is performed, we can never be completely sure that what we are about to do is the right thing.

Yet every moral theory has to allow for some degree of moral ignorance cases where we don't know what is right or wrong. We are not morally infallible. Many utilitarians explain this by saying that since we don't have a crystal ball, and can't perfectly predict the future, we can never be certain in advance that our actions are morally right.

Greed, malice, ingratitude these are bound to make most people's top ten list of moral vices. Utilitarianism easily explains this. When people are motivated by such things, they tend to harm others. Utilitarians thus condemn such traits as vices. So do we.

**CH 10**

According to utilitarianism, we must do what is optimific. We must maximize overall well-being. Thus, to know whether an action is morally required, we need to do four things: (1) add up all of the benefits it produces, (2) add up all of the harm it causes, (3) determine the balance, and then (4) see whether the balance is greater than that of any other available action.

Problems of value measurement arise even for hedonism (and other views that identify just a single thing as intrinsically beneficial). After all, happiness comes in many flavors. There is the happiness of momentary elation, of steady contentment, of physical excitement, of mental challenge, of exhausted gratitude. And that is only a small portion of the catalogue. Given these different kinds of happiness, it would be very surprising if there were some common [measures] of happiness that applied to each person.
