CHAPTER 11 -

**Despite any good results that may come from their actions, these people did wrong or so we think. And the explanation of their immorality is simple. What they did was unfair. They took advantage of the system. They broke the rules that work to everyone's benefit. They violated the rights of others. No matter how much personal gain such actions bring, they are still wrong, because they are unfair and unjust. (Page 160)**

Having integrity is living in harmony with the principles you believe in. It is the virtue of consistency. Integrity requires that you resist making an exception of yourself£ It demands that you follow your principles even when doing so comes at a real cost. (Page 171)

Integrity is worthy of our admiration only when it is tied to morally legitimate principles. The problem, as we have seen, is that people of integrity may still be doing wrong. Refusing to make an exception of myself is no guarantee that my principles are morally acceptable. It's not that consistency is worthless. But it fails as a general test for the morality of the principles we live by. (Page 171)

**For Kant, we can't determine whether an act is right or wrong until we know its maxim. And for any given action, there are countless maxims that might support it (Page 173)**

**A maxim is a principle that you give yourself. (Page 173)**

CHAPTER 12 –

Is there anything wrong, in and of itself, with enslaving other people? (Page 175)

Kant regarded many of the basic moral rules as absolute, and so insisted that it is never acceptable to break them even if breaking them leads to better results (Page 192)
