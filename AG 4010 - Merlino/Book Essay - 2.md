Read the chapters for the assignment, see Pp if posted, then watch the video. Then write the following by tying the ethical video to the ethical chapters assigned. You can agree or disagree how the chapters relate to the video.

For the **Book Assignments**- Three detailed paragraphs (minimum 5 sentences per paragraph, more if you want more points)- One quote with quotation marks and cited APA from the book(Book or Chapter Pp) in each of three paragraphs is mandatory. So each paragraph has a quote with quotation marks and cited in APA from the book (three quotes minimum from the book for the assignment).  Then discuss the ethical quote by quoting or paraphrasing from at least one other (agricultural sources, article or video that relates to the agriculture issue) in each of three paragraphs. Each paragraph has a quote from the book and at least one cited paraphrase or quote from another source that relates to the agriculture issue brought up in the yellow highlighted video. Four total sources for the assignment!

Do not include the assigned video in the references for Three Paragraph Assignment or the Final Movie Paper. You may write about them without citing or reference.

Example-

Paragraph 1

Quote with quotation marks from Shafer-Landau (Book or Chapter Pp) (reference 1) in APA

Quote or paraphrase from agriculture source (reference 2) in APA

Connect the two with writing from knowledge gained from your book, Pps, and additional sources.
