& -> Bitwise and
| -> Bitwise OR
^ -> Bitwise XOR (exclusive OR)
<< -> Left shift
">>" -> Right Shit
~ Bitwise Not

1. The ****& (bitwise AND)**** in C takes two numbers as operands and does AND on every bit of two numbers. The result of AND is 1 only if both bits are 1.  
2. The ****| (bitwise OR)**** in C takes two numbers as operands and does OR on every bit of two numbers. The result of OR is 1 if any of the two bits is 1. 
3. The ****^ (bitwise XOR)**** in C takes two numbers as operands and does XOR on every bit of two numbers. The result of XOR is 1 if the two bits are different. 
4. The ****<< (left shift)**** in C takes two numbers, the left shifts the bits of the first operand, and the second operand decides the number of places to shift. 
5. The ****>> (right shift)**** in C takes two numbers, right shifts the bits of the first operand, and the second operand decides the number of places to shift. 
6. The ****~ (bitwise NOT)**** in C takes one number and inverts all bits of it.
