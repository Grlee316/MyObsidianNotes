replacing missing data using median or averages
mostly using the median to replace the data 
then store the median into a variable

cyclic learning -> will automate these learning process
simple imputer -> this is a class
everything is in classes
subclass -> impute

estimator (.fit())
transformer (.fit(),.transform())
predictor (.fit(), .predictor())


hyperparameters -> its a set parameter
learn parameter -> will learn from the data
.fit() will compute a generated specifics

input panda, output numpy -> convert it back to panda again

.fit() is only on **Training**
you fit it to training data
you can transform the train data

instantize an object (create an object)
what method to encode it? use the .fit()

one hot encoding -> 

fit transform -> fit the data and transform the data?
if there's an extra category -> it will output zeroes
sparse matrix -> 

what kind of scaling we should use?
heavy tails -> with log, it will look like a gaussian distribution
linear trainsformation -> by using normalization (min-max scaling)
other method is to take the log and do the normalization

standardization -> standard normal distribution
**z scores** -> x - miu / sigma  -> most of the value will be near zero
mean is zero, does not restricted to ranges 0 - 1

imputed 
every feature will be scaled -> will have their min - max value

import -> create an instance -> fit transform, and then give the imputed ones

missing data -> checked
categorical data -> checked
scaling data -> checked

we will create pipelines
