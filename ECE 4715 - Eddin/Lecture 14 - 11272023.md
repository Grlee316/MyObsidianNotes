support vector machine
support vector classifier -> SVC
support vector regression -> SGR

no regularization
convergence warning if we put the data at somewhere random

linear kernel

O(m^2 x n)-> O(m^3 x n)


2 classes
linear svc (no kernel, only linear, faster ) -> uses (mxn)
svc (computational is slow but more feature) -> have kernels
