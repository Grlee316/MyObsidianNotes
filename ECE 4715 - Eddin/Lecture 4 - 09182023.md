Regression
classification - class (hair color, etc)
multiple regression

input x -> Machine Learning -> Output y
synthetic is not real
kaggle -> datasets

-> Download the data
-> fetcher, called fetch_california_housing
-> as frame = True -> Databases, Data frame
-> Internal data type as bunch (bunch datasets) -> pretty much is a dictionary
-> key values, hash table, etc.
-> some data will have an image as an input
-> we will have tabular data (organized as a table)
-> if there's missing attribute, we need to fix it
-> pandas frame
-> panda is excel on steroid
-> target / labels -> y (associated with regression or classes)
-> numerical / categorical datasets
-> go online - get a tar.gz file - uncompress it  - get a csv files
-> head -> first point or how many points you want to see head(20) gives your 20 rows
-> 


heavy tail

when your datasets comes in
shuffles the datasets by doing stratified shuffling

biasing the model if you add the test sets to the training sets, so the model will train about the test sets as well
covariance, correlation coefficient, 
correlation matrices
scatter matrix
anywhere that's empty, put the median in it
everything you do, you do it on the training
