Decision tree
moral

if the decision tree grow, it will really grow
you can restrict the model

train
validation
test

RMSE on every single validation
cross validation

the idea is the type of your training will change your data

random forest regression
you not going to see the whole trees
you're going to see some subset of the trees

10 random forest on different subsets

we can do a grid search

median 
- drop 4,6,8
- pass 4,6,8

mean
- drop 4,6,8
- pass 4,6,8

36 training have at the same time

features = keys
values is the values
different combination of a grid seacrch
54 rounds (54 models that are being trained)

pretrain -> someone have been training this
huggingface -> they trained the model already

learn it after fit

did not know what to put that's why its not a number
auto machine learning

can get the best parameter
can get the best estimator
