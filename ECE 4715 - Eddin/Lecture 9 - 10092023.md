Classification -> we're classifying stuffs (classes)
the last one we create a numerical

check the piplining

Jpeg does a cosine transform
huffman encoding

imread
imshow

generator (make, etc)
load (fetch )
there are different fethecer
openML

we're not doing with tabular data anymore
we're dealing with picture
and the output will be classification

data type is a bunch

jet -> default colormap in matlab

if the colored picture, then you will have RGB maps
rgb -> 4 dimensions

number of dimension -> ndim

x.ndim
y.shape

false class -> about 10 times
gradient descent


import -> teach -> learn
hyperparaeter
supervised algorithm technique

decisision function
positive good plus
negative number negative plus
the treshold is not a retraining
we will control the treshold
effects how good is our predictions are
linear classifier

finding a1 and a2 is called optimization algorithm
